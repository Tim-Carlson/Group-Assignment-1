# Group-Assignment-1

This project needs json.simple in a referenced library to run properly,
I found it here: http://www.java2s.com/Code/Jar/j/Downloadjsonsimple111jar.htm

There are still things todo:
-There is no function for writing site info to Json file
-There is pretty much no input validation
-Site info still displays null reading information, probably should remove those readings until set with data
-The Site collection open/close buttons don't do anything
-We could increase functionality, such as a drop-down list that shows the available Site ids to choose from and view
