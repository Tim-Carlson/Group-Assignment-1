# Group-Assignment-1

This project needs json.simple in a referenced library to run properly,
I found it here: http://www.java2s.com/Code/Jar/j/Downloadjsonsimple111jar.htm

There are still things todo:</br>
There is no function for writing site info to Json file, and no button to do so.</br>
There is pretty much no input validation.</br>
Site info still displays null reading information, probably should remove those readings until set with data.</br>
The Site collection open/close buttons don't do anything.</br>
The Site Class should have a ArrayList of type Reading, instead of four hard-coded reading instantiations. The toString methods will probably need to be changed to display properly</br>
We could increase functionality, such as a drop-down list that shows the available Site ids to choose from and view.</br>
